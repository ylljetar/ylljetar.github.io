					<p>In Save the Children's report "Save our education" 12 countries are highlighted as particularly vulnerable. One of these countries is Nigeria. Here 10.5 million (equivalent to 38%) children do not go to school. «The writing and reading skills here are among the very lowest. If you are a girl in northeastern Nigeria, you are at the very back of the global school class.» The target group is children aged 6-11 years. Teachers at the school are responsible for follow-up and guidance when using the tablet. Implementation takes place on the school grounds. It is here product and the technology will be used. This presupposes the training of teachers and students.</p>

                        <p>To ensure and collect good data about students' attendance at school, we envisage a user-friendly, solar-powered tablet. The user interface is illustrated below.
                            Picture 1 illustrates what the students encounter every morning. Before entering the classroom, they must register digitally via a wall-mounted tablet. Each student prints on the image of himself.
                            Picture 2: Then the student enters a personal, digital code.
                            Picture 3 illustrates what appears if the student did not register the previous day. Regardless of how many days the student has been away since the previous registration, the student chooses which reason (s) best describes the absence.
                            NB! For students who registered the day before, the symbols will not appear, but the student will be sent back to the start page, and the next student can register.</p>

                            <p>We assume that electricity and hence internet is not a matter of course for most schools in Nigeria. The tablets are therefore solar powered and not dependent on the internet. It could also be an opportunity to build on Save the Children's existing project in Nigeria where they release radios with built-in solar panels for students.
                                Via the tablets, data is collected in larger databases in cities where representatives from Save the Children process the information.
                                The data is stored on a hard disk that can, for example, be sent by mail. It is important that the software is open-source, so
                                that other organizations and countries can use the software / GUI.
                                When the information is collected in the database, it is important to safeguard privacy by ensuring that unauthorized persons do not gain access
                                on the data.</p>

                                <p>Actors such as Unicef, the UN, the Red Cross and other local organizations will, in addition to Save the Children, be expected to engage in the project with financial resources. Crowdfunding, social media, companies and personal investors can also be involved for financial support. In countries like Nigeria, schooling is compulsory, which makes it a reasonable assumption that the national government also wants to contribute with incentive schemes and financial support. Another important prerequisite is that the project is able to produce / acquire affordable tablets. The number of tablets is scalable and depends on capacity, resources and other conditions. For schools in the northernmost areas of Nigeria, the idea is one tablet per class / school. In the more central parts of the country there may be several tablets - e.g. One tablet per student / per two students.</p>
